# Microservice HTTP + gRPC Prototype

The idea is simple, host an API Gateway that supports HTTP Rest. Meanwhile all business logic is done inside of a microservice that is callable via gRPC.

This is a work in progress and the requirements might change over time.

Currently this is working in Python, but I am thinking about moving it to golang.
